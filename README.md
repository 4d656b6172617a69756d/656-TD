# 656-TD

test for the sake of testing because why not
=======
Small Tower Defense project for the sake of figuring out what Unity can and can't do. 

works: 
- spawns: different enemy types with different scaling depending on the type of the enemy
- abilities: slow/damage all enemies, income
- building: two towers are available
- camera: zoom in/out/wasd + locking on
- bounty system: depends on the enemy type, scuffed up for now and needs some rewriting
- catch mechanic: every enemy that dies gives you gold in intervals

todo:
- balancing: scaling, tower lvlups
- features: pre-made mazes, maybe randomly-generated ones later
- sound: the game's completely silent rn.
