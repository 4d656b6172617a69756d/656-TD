# 656-TD

Small Tower Defense project for the sake of figuring out what Unity can and can't do. 

works: 
- spawns: different enemy types with different scaling depending on the type of the enemy
- abilities: slow/damage all enemies
- building: two towers are available
- camera: zoom in/out/wasd + locking on
- bounty system: depends on the enemy type

todo:
- balancing: currency, towers, scaling, income, tower levelups
- features: "catch" mechanic, pre-made mazes, maybe randomly-generated ones later
- sound: the game's completely silent rn.
